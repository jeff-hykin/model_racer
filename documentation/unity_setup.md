### Setup

1. Download or clone this repository (Note: it is currently quite large)<br>
    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/jeff-hykin/model_racer.git`
    
2. Download Unity Hub (from an App Store, Package manger, or Unity's website)
    - agree to the license thing (green arrow)
    - press back (yellow arrow)

    - go to projects (should be empty)
    <img src="/documentation/images/unity_hub.png" alt="where-to-click">

    - click the "Add", find the model_racer folder you just downloaded, inside that folder go into the `unity` folder, and inside that open the `car-track-environment` folder
    - Then click the name of the project ("car-track-environment"), and there should be a black pop-up (at the bottom) like this
    <img src="/documentation/images/install_prompt.png" alt="where-to-click">
    
    - Click install, then try opening the project again

3. Opening up the scene
    - You won't see the blue guy, but your menus should look something like this
    <img src="/documentation/images/car_track_scene.png" alt="where-to-click">

    - Under the project tab (White arrow)
    - Select `Assets` (Lime green arrow)
    - Select `Scenes` (Green arrow)
    - Select `CarTrainPython.unity` (Blue arrow)
4. Now you should be able to see the car/track!
