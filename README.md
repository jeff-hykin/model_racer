### Setup

1. Download Unity Hub (App Storer, Package manger, or Unity's website)
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Open the "OpenMeWithUnity" folder
    - You probably won't see the blue guy yet, but the menus should look something like
    <img src="/documentation/images/basic_run.png" alt="where-to-clock">
    - Then (red arrow) open the "Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/3DBall/Scenes" folder
    - Then (blue arrow) open the "3DBall" Scene
    - (don't do the green arrow yet)
4. Open the `OpenMeInTextEditor/main.py` file in a text editor (this should look familiar as a stanard python RL setup)
5. Follow the setup instructions in `./documentation/SETUP.md`
6. Inside the shell (from the setup) run `run main`
7. Now click the green arrow inside Unity
