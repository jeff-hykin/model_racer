### Setup

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Download Unity Hub (from an App Storer, Package manger, or Unity's website)
    - agree to the license thing
    - press back (top left corner)
    - go to projects (should be empty)

    - click the "Add" then open the `OpenMeWithUnity` folder from this repository (e.g. `model_racer/OpenMeWithUnity`)
    - Then click the name of the project, and there should be a pop-up like this

    - Click install, then try opening the project again
3. Opening up the scene
    - You probably won't see the blue guy yet, but the menus should look something like
    <img src="/documentation/images/basic_run.png" alt="where-to-clock">

    - To see the blue guy
      - open the "Assets/ML-Agents/Examples/3DBall/Scenes" folder (red arrow)
      - Then open the "3DBall" Scene (blue arrow)
      - (don't do the green arrow yet)
4. With your favorite text editor open the `OpenMeInTextEditor/main.py` file (this should look familiar as a stanard python RL setup)
5. Follow the setup instructions in `./documentation/SETUP.md`
6. Inside the shell (from the setup.md) run `run main`
7. Now click the green arrow inside Unity

8. (you should see output inside the shell now!)
